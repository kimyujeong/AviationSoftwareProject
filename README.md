# Introduction
We loaded the most accessible features in RC into the Android App, making it easy for anyone to use RC of drones that are difficult to operate. *Intuition* has been implemented so that users can operate drones without being distracted by operating the app. Using *PX4* and *ROS* open source, I collected sensing information of the drone, controlled the position of the drone. With the experience of using an open source, I will be able to quickly adapt and apply to various system development. And also, through this project, I had an understanding of various systems ranging from S/W to H/W.

# Objectives
* *ROS* : Implementing offboard code for functions such as east-west, north-south movement, up-and-down movement, rotation, etc.
*  *Android* : Implementation of *ROS* Node-*Android* Communication, GUI Design, Parameter Restriction.
*  *H/W* : Drone assembly and management, *QGC* calibration, *QGC* to offboard node connection
